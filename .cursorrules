## Document Versioning Rules

### STRICT RULE: Initial Document Version
**Every document MUST have an initial version created immediately upon document creation.**
- No conditions or workarounds allowed
- Initial version must be created even if content is empty
- If version creation fails, document creation must fail (no silent failures)
- This ensures data integrity and proper version history from the start

### Implementation Requirements
- When creating a document, an initial version snapshot must be created synchronously
- Version metadata must be initialized before or during initial version creation
- No conditional checks like `if (content)` before creating initial version
- Errors in version creation must propagate and fail the document creation
